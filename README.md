# Project 4: Dice Roller

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 4 and the corresponding labs for the MHS Software Engineering class. 
The focus of this project is on creating functional programming blocks in Python, including defining functions, returning values, parameter usage, and implementing exception handling.

## Main Project: Dice Roller
- File: [`dice-roller.py`](dice-roller.py)
- Description: Develop a dice roller application that simulates rolling dice. 
- Use functions to structure your code, return values from functions, accept parameters, and include exception handling to deal with unexpected inputs.

## Labs

### Lab 1: Introduction to Functions
- File: [`lab1.py`](lab1.py)
- Description: Introduce the concept of functions and how they can be used in Python.

### Lab 2: Functions with Parameters
- File: [`lab2.py`](lab2.py)
- Description: Expand upon the introduction of functions by incorporating parameters and arguments.

### Lab 3: Exception Handling
- File: [`lab3.py`](lab3.py)
- Description: Understand and implement exception handling to manage errors gracefully.
